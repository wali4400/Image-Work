    <p>Faisalabad was once part of ancient district Jhang and Sandalbar, 
    mainly consisting of thick forests and local tribes. The city of Lyallpur came into being in 1880 with the city 
    center designed by Captain Poham Young, to imitate the Union Flag with eight roads radiating from a large 
    clock tower (Ghenta Ghar) in the centre of eight separate bazaars. In 1895, the rail link between Wazirabad 
    and Lyallpur was completed. As the progress of colonization stepped up, Lyallpur was given the status of 
    a Tehsil of Jhang District and its administration carried on in tents on the old Theh (Mound) of Pucca Mari
    near Tariqabad. In 1943, Muhammad Ali Jinnah came to Lyallpur and addressed a gathering of over 2 million 
    in Dhobi Ghat ground. The city grew into a strong industrial and agricultural centre and on independence 
    of Pakistan it was a major urban area. In 1977, the name of the city was “Faisalabad”, after the late King
    Faisal of Saudi Arabia to commemorate deep friendship which exists between the two great Islamic countries
    of the world. In 1985, Faisalabad was upgraded as a division with the districts of Faisalabad, Jhang and 
    Toba Tek Singh.</p>
